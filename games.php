			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/93227"><h3>Space Odyssey</h3></a>
			<p class="specs">March 2013<br>Made with Processing</p>
			<p>4 players work together on the same keyboard to shoot down the enemy before he consumes them all! Mauricio Sanchez-Duque, Michael Kahane and I created this prototype for our studies at Parsons the New School for Design. The game went over smashingly in class.</p>

			<p class="specs"><a href="writing/spacejunk_documentation.pdf">Documentation</a> | February 2013<br>Made with Processing</p>
			<p>Who knew going into orbit was such a challenge? Owen Herterich, Michael Kahane and I found out when we created this prototype. To run the full version <a href="music.php">with music</a>, use <a target="_blank" href="http://processing.org/download/">Processing</a> to open spaceJunk.pde in the zip archive and press Play. You can also play Stage 1 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/90457">here</a>.</p>

			<a href="games/art_thief_training_grounds.zip"><h3>Art Thief: TG</h3></a>
			<p class="specs"><a href="writing/art_thief_training_grounds_documentation.pdf">Documentation</a> | December 2012<br><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jmatthewgriffis/Fall2012final">Code</a> | Made with openFrameworks</p>
			<p><span class="italics">Art Thief: Training Grounds</span> has lasers, a painting and a descriptive title. Anything else you need to know? I created this experiment in 3D gameplay for my studies at Parsons the New School for Design. Runs on Mac OS X 10.6+ but probably <a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/JWwfjF-8maw">not PC</a> (take that, <span class="italics">Platformal Ware</span>!).</p>

			<p class="specs"><a href="writing/how_to_play_documentation.pdf">Documentation</a> | November 2012<br>Made with Processing</p>
			<p>How the heck do you play this? You may think you know, but I doubt it. I created this examination of how games instruct their players for my studies at Parsons the New School for Design. Good luck reaching the end credits. Seriously, it may be completely opaque.</p>

			<p class="specs"><a href="writing/arduino_invader_documentation.pdf">Documentation</a> | October 2012<br>Made with Processing and Arduino</p>
			<p>The aliens are invading! Oh, there's just one. There comes a time in a man's life when he decides to build his own arcade game controller while learning about electronics and physical computing. For me, that time came during my studies at Parsons the New School for Design.</p>

			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/68684"><h3>Frustration</h3></a>
			<p class="specs">September 2012<br>Made with Processing</p>
			<p>Click on the ball to score points. It's simple enough. I created this "game" for my studies at Parsons the New School for Design. The assignment was to make something expressing (or, perhaps, inducing) an emotion. Results from playtesting are positive.</p>

			<p class="specs">August 2012<br>Made with Processing</p>
			<p>A physics platform game with balls. Use the mouse to move one ball and bounce the other off of it. Press 's' on the title screen for Schmaltz mode. I created this for my final project in the Code section of the pre-program "Bootcamp" at Parsons the New School for Design.</p>

			<p class="specs">December 2011<br>Made with GameMaker</p>
			<p>Avatar? Platforms? You know what to do. I created this PC-only game demo as part of my application to graduate school, little suspecting that everyone uses a Mac. I composed and performed the soundtrack, too (<a href="music.php">available here</a> in a platform-agnostic set of formats).</p>

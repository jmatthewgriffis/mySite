			<p>Once again, four players work together to shoot down the enemy before it consumes them all! Mauricio Sanchez-Duque and I made this follow-up to our previous game.

			<p>There's a new trend in games: taking control away. Between endless cut-scenes and endless runners, it's like these games just don't want to be played! This can only end in a game that verbally abuses the player for trying to play it.</p>

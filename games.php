			<h3>Best Game Ever (Space Odyssey)</h3>
		</a>
		<p>Best Game Ever is the best game ever. It's also known as Space Odyssey (an m^3 studios production). m^3 studios is Mauricio Sanchez-Duque, Michael Kahane and Matt Griffis. We created this game for the Play project in our Major Studio 2 class, as part of our studies for the MFA in Design and Technology at Parsons the New School for Design. I coded the player movement, Mauricio coded the enemy movement and supplied the art, and Michael coded the life, collision detection and bullet systems and made other enhancements. The game went over smashingly in class.</p>

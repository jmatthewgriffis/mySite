			<p>Once again, 4 players work together to shoot down the enemy before it consumes them all! Mauricio Sanchez-Duque and I made this follow-up to our previous game, subtitled "Michael Kahane's Defection."

			<p class="specs"><a href="writing/thesis_1_doc_list.html">Documentation</a> | December 2013<br>Made with openFrameworks</p>
			<p>The first half of the Thesis year at Parsons MFADT is dedicated to developing a thesis concept, and at the end of the semester I presented this prototype of a new type of music game. I also documented the process thoroughly, as may be seen above.</p>

			<p>Not a game, but in the interactive category, this Parsons group project was a collaboration with Miami's New World Symphony. Michael Kahane, Quincy Bock, Mauricio Sanchez-Duque, Francesca Castelli, and I developed responsive, generative software for use in concert.</p>

			<p>I don't often struggle for closure after the credits roll, but <a target="_blank" href="http://superhexagon.com/">Super Hexagon</a> haunted me in a way few games do. I made this in response (submitted as a final project for two classes at Parsons--see the two papers above). Move with the ARROWS; press SPACE to interact.</p>

			<p>There's a new trend in games: taking control away. Between endless cut-scenes and endless runners, it's like these games just don't want to be played! This can only end in a game that verbally abuses the player for trying to play it. I am proud to present "Don't Play Me Bro!"</p>

			<a href="images/games/screen__building_worlds_final__full.png"><img src="images/games/screen__building_worlds_final__crop.png" alt="Experiments in Unity3D" title="Maybe I'll just go back to bed." /></a>
			<h3>Experiments in Unity3D</h3>
			<p class="specs">Spring 2013<br>Made with Unity3D, C# and Maya</p>
			<p>I took a class in learning Unity3D. Nothing too polished came out of it, but I kept a narrative thread going through some of the assignments and played with cinematic direction--<a href="games/unity_bw_list.html">click here</a> for the vignettes.

			<p>4 players work together on the same keyboard to shoot down the enemy before it consumes them all! Mauricio Sanchez-Duque, Michael Kahane and I created this prototype for our studies at Parsons the New School for Design. The game went over smashingly in class.</p>

			<p>Who knew going into orbit was so perilous? Owen Herterich, Michael Kahane and I found out when we created this prototype. To run the two-stage version with music, use <a target="_blank" href="http://processing.org/download/">Processing</a> to open spaceJunk.pde in the zip archive and press Play.

			<p><span class="italics">Art Thief: Training Grounds</span> has lasers, a painting and a descriptive title. Anything else you need to know? I created this experiment in 3D gameplay for my studies at Parsons the New School for Design. Runs on Mac OS X 10.6+ but probably <a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/JWwfjF-8maw">not PC</a> (take that, <span class="italics">Platformal Ware</span>!).</p>

			<p>How the heck do you play this? You may think you know, but I doubt it. I created this examination of how games instruct their players for my studies at Parsons the New School for Design. Good luck reaching the end credits. Seriously, it may be completely opaque.</p>

			<p>The aliens are invading! Oh, there's just one. There comes a time in a man's life when he decides to build his own arcade game controller while learning about electronics and physical computing. For me, that time came during my studies at Parsons the New School for Design.</p>

			<p>Click on the ball to score points. It's simple enough. I created this "game" for my studies at Parsons the New School for Design. The assignment was to make something expressing (or, perhaps, inducing) an emotion. Results from playtesting are positive.</p>

			<p>A physics platform game with balls. Use the mouse to move one ball and bounce the other off of it. Press 's' on the title screen for Schmaltz mode. I created this for my final project in the Code section of the pre-program "Bootcamp" at Parsons the New School for Design.</p>

			<p class="specs">December 2011<br><a href="music.php">Music</a> | Made with GameMaker</p>
			<p>It's the classic story of a girl who chases her dog into the woods and has to fend off ferocious creatures and jump over inexplicable spike pits. I created this PC-only game demo as part of my application to graduate school, little suspecting that everyone uses a Mac.</p>

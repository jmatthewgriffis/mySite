					<h2>About this Project</h2>

					<p>In the summer and fall of 2013, I did some work for Parsons' own Prototyping, Education and Technology Lab (<a target="_blank" href="http://petlab.parsons.edu/">PETLab</a>) on an update to their "Activate!" project. Activate! is a Web site and curriculum about learning to make games, with a focus on social issues. From <a target="_blank" href="http://activategames.org/">the Web site</a>: "The games on Activate! celebrate getting active and solving problems on your street, in your town, and around the world."</p>

					<p>When I came to the project, the curriculum consisted of a series of written <a target="_blank" href="http://activategames.org/challenges/game-design-challenges">game design challenges</a>, starting at a beginner level and increasing in sophistication, which students would take on using the no-programming-required application <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yoyogames.com/studio">GameMaker</a>. My task was to update the curriculum using a new application: the (also) no-programming-required <a target="_blank" href="http://gamesalad.com/">GameSalad</a>. This involved "porting" the games from GameMaker to GameSalad (i.e. recreating them in the new application), writing new tutorials, and also (brand new to the curriculum) recording video versions of the tutorials.</p>

					<p>This page presents the results.</p>

					<h3>Some Notes</h3>

					<p>Due to time constraints, I was not able to finish the tutorial (written and video) for the final game, Lights Off. This is very annoying. However, I did finish recreating the game itself, so at least you can check that out, which is something considering how difficult that particular game was to port. (It turned out well, though!)</p>

					<p>I was not involved in the creation of the original Activate! curriculum. I did not come up with the designs for these games, or build the original versions (or write the original tutorials); neither did I create the assets used in the games, such as the images. I have linked in each entry to the old curriculum's corresponding page, where you can find the original resources. I did write the new tutorials, and the video scripts, and I made the videos (so any hint of amateur videography is my fault and 100% accurate).</p>

					<p>And, of course, I built the GameSalad versions of these games. I have reproduced the original GameMaker games as faithfully as I could, but GameSalad is a different program, and some differences were insurmountable and required design changes to the games. Mostly this had to do with the smaller screen size GameSalad imposed so the games would be playable in a Web browser. The larger levels of the GameMaker originals simply wouldn't work in the smaller layout, so I had to redesign the levels in Solarball, Smog Cloud Madness, and Operation Green Clean (this was actually a lot of fun, so there's that smog cloud's silver lining). Lights Off was a whole other kettle of fish; I discuss that in the game's entry on this page. The whole porting experience was the genesis of an essay I wrote later for my Game Studies class, <a href="../../writing/Griffis_Game_Studies_Research_Paper.pdf">a critical study of GameSalad</a>.</p>

					<h3>A Caveat</h3>

					<p>This Activate! update hasn't been tested out or officially gone live (the unfinished nature of Lights Off surely doesn't help), and the work I did on it belongs to PETLab. Many thanks to them for granting me permission to present it here. This was a fun project and I worked hard on it.</p>

					<h3>Some Technical Notes</h3>

					<h4>Is this Game Broken?</h4>

					<p>The games are embedded in this page, so you can play them! They may run a little funny over time (or simply end); click the gear icon underneath any game to make a menu appear, which includes an option to reload the game.</p>

					<h4>What's With that Sound?</h4>

					<p>You may notice a sporadic sound effect; that's <a href="#solarball">Solarball</a>. The games are all silent, except that one, because part of the lesson is how to use sound effects (as you can hear, the lesson was successful!). The embedded games play automatically, and unfortunately I don't know of a way to mute them. Sorry about that. I prefer to think of this as a feature: if you get drowsy while reading the lessons, Solarball will wake you up and make you pay attention.</p>

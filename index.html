						<p>I design and develop interactive experiences, mostly digital. Creating play, telling stories, and enabling others’ creativity are my aims. The funnier or more moving the experience, the better.</p>

						<p>Technology is my toolset and playground. I work across many mediums and formats, such as games, Web, installations, and everything in-between: anywhere there is opportunity to combine programming and design in an interesting and provocative way, I am there.</p>

						<p>I hold a Master of Fine Arts in Design and Technology from <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/bp_QFY09yMY">Parsons School of Design</a>, as well as a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts from <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZAQ4X2BYFnA">St. John’s College</a>.<!-- I draw on the rich content of the latter (math, science, and the humanities) and interpret and explore it through the tools and techniques of the former (design thinking and creative computation).--> Philosophy, the Western literary canon, and ancient languages meets algorithmic animation, Web development, and game design! This is a site to watch.</p>

						<p>Speaking of which, this Web portfolio documents many of my creative projects, from my 2008 post-college (and pre-coding) writing experiments, to the many assignments of my Parsons years, and beyond.<!-- One of my favorite things to do is to make games (I studied game design extensively at Parsons), so that category is well-represented.--> Life gets so serious! Play a game. Or laugh at a silly Web site or learn something or make some music or play around in virtual reality: it’s all good, and you can find it all here.</p>

							<p>A Web comic about what comes after graduating college.</p>
							<img src="images/projects/otherwise_employed/otherwise_employed1.png">
							<p>I wrote and drew a series of comic strips (concurrently with writing the "Sage Mathias" blog) while looking for work as a newly-minted liberal arts graduate. Let's just say, "catharsis." I recommend starting at the beginning [link below] for the strongest material.</p>

							<h3>Sage Mathias</h3>
							<p>2008–2009</p>
							<p>My first blog! I wrote Sage Mathias (concurrently with making the "Otherwise Employed" Web comic) while looking for work post-college. The post topics were, er, wide-ranging, from the expected pop culture in my life, to musings on coffee, to grammatical snobbery (mine).</p>
							<p>I didn't really know what I was doing (other than publishing words on the Web), and that took me in some interesting directions. My favorite, by far, was when I decided to write a comic-fantasy short story, and serialized it over 11 blog posts. I often forget that I wrote this little nugget. No planning went into the tale, and I make no claims as to its quality, but I think I landed some good jokes in there. I've provided a link to the first installment (plus one to the blog's beginning) below.</p>

				        <br><br>
				        What, you want more than that? OK, how about 13 levels of reach-the-goal action, multiple endings, 'unlimited lives' and 'single life' modes, all sorts of statistics-tracking (including Best Time to get through the game), and squash-and-stretch animation for that charismatic square with three jumps to spare? 
				        <br><br>
				        I made You Can Triple-Jump for my Level Design independent study at Parsons. I designed the levels around three primary principles: teaching the player how to play using the level layouts themselves (implicit tutorial); applying the core mechanic of triple-jumping in as many ways and contexts as possible; providing a fluctuating (but gradually increasing) challenge with sufficient variety to maintain interest.

				        data-description="The challenge: design an experience that takes full advantage of the affordances of the Oculus Rift. In other words, something about acting on things by looking at them while wearing a visor. Listen, it's pretty obvious where this is going. 
				        <br><br>
				        You are a...special individual with the 'gift' of shooting lasers from your eyes. You can control the beams with your stylish visor, but you need some practice. Enter the simulation room and train against an army of fearsome mannequins, shooting-gallery-style.
				        <br><br>
				        Cycloculus was created by <a target='_blank' href='http://www.whomakesgames.me/'>K. Anthony Marefat</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://bryan-ma.com/'>Bryan Ma</a>, and me for the Recursive Reality class at Parsons. Anthony and I split most of the coding duties, while Bryan delivered the 3D models, beam effects, and the rest of the visual design.
				        <br><br>
				        Cycloculus achieves several objectives we set for ourselves. First and foremost, we control the experience almost exclusively with looking, the primary function and greatest strength of the hardware. The project avoids the use of external controllers that would be cumbersome and disruptive to use while immersed in the visor.
				        <br><br>
				        Second, we give the player the ability to fire the laser by tapping the side of the visor; in the prototype this takes the form of a MakeyMakey unit and some tin foil to complete a circuit and simulate a button-press whenever the person makes contact. This adds a feeling of control, the tactile satisfaction of tapping a button, and contextual consistency since it makes sense within the narrative context to be tapping the visor to fire.
				        <br><br>
				        Third, the experience is immediately intuitive and conveys a sense of power and fun, as we discovered through playtesting.
				        <br><br>
				        Finally, despite the crudeness of the prototype in its software and hardware implementations, Cycloculus attains a degree of immersion and presence, as we saw in our playtesters' visceral reactions to the flying objects, their laughter and delight as they blasted the targets, and their willingness to play for extended periods.

				        I collaborated with <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sanchezmauricio.com/'>Mauricio Sanchez Duque</a> to create this follow-up to our previous game for the Algorithmic Animation class at Parsons. Once again we prioritized making players share the same keyboard, but because it only accepts six simultaneous button inputs and we have a three-button-per-player control scheme for a four-player game, math necessitates extra hardware. So Players 3 and 4 use a second computer's keyboard, connected via a custom app I wrote using OSC over a network connection.

				        <br><br>

				        <br><br>
				        Splitting into teams, the class used the music and the musicians themselves as raw materials to transform a public performance in NWS's spectacular Frank Gehry-designed concert hall into a transmedia synaesthetic experience.
				        <br><br>
				        I worked with <a target='_blank' href='http://www.michaelkahane.com/'>Michael Kahane</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://quincybock.com/'>Quincy Bock</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sanchezmauricio.com/'>Mauricio Sanchez Duque</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.fracastelli.com/'>Francesca Castelli</a> to make 'Breath and Brass,' a visual piece for Poulenc’s 'Sonata for Horn, Trumpet and Trombone' that illuminates both the physical and technical aspects of musical performance.
				        <br><br>
				        We built a custom sensor to measure the musicians' breathing, and employed FFT software to analyze the music they played. Our custom-built program blended and interpreted the breathing and music data to synthesize a visual accompaniment live during the concert.
				        <br><br>
				        I worked on the software, primarily on coding the 'Lines' segment (one of two narrative themes) and on merging everyone's individual programs into a single application.

				        The class was conducted under the leadership of Ed Keller, Joe Saavedra, and Leif Percifield. Breath and Brass was made in November of 2013 and programmed in openFrameworks and Arduino."

				        data-description="The cheerful board game Dixit about matching images to words becomes...something else, in this unholy fusion of the mundanity of Twitter and the horrors of 4chan, born in the depths of the Humor and Code class at Parsons.
				        <br><br>
				        Designed in the style of a game show for public performance, Dicksit solicits a prompt from the audience (inspired by improv comedy), then searches Twitter for a related Tweet, which goes up on a public screen for all to see. Each contestant receives on a private mobile device a random thread of images from the notorious 4chan message boards--some of the images might even be appropriate for work and young children! (Probably not, though.)
				        <br><br>Each candidate selects an image to represent the content of the Tweet, and sends it to the public screen, with no name attached. Once each candidate has chosen, the audience votes to determine the winning image. The victorious contestant reveals his or her identity and is showered in glory, while the losers console themselves with the grotesqueries of the rest of their 4chan threads.
				        <br><br>
				        This extremely tongue-in-cheek game using cutting-edge technology was a group project between me, <a target='_blank' href='http://josephrogermoore.com/'>Joe Moore</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://jenniferpresto.com/'>Jennifer Presto</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.siriwanpen.com/'>Siri Wanpen</a>. I built the site to run on the public screen. We made Dicksit in May of 2013 and developed it with Node.js, WebSockets, HTML, CSS, and the Twitter and 4chan APIs."

The robot does hover, though, so there wouldn't be friction. Consistency! Featuring Robot from the aforementioned 3D modeling.

We found out the hard way that the keyboard only recognizes up to six simultaneous buttons inputs; fortunately the chaotic nature of the shoot-em-up action means it's not too much of a problem even with four players. The combination engine/cannon means every attack moves the player toward the target, making for tense action. Made in March of 2013 and programmed in JavaScript using Processing.js."

Exploring how to illuminate and promote discussion of otherwise-invisible networks on which the public depends, we used Processing to create in two weeks this prototype of an educational game about the phenomenon of 'space junk.'
				        <br><br>
				        In the first stage, dodge a multitude of satellites to make it into orbit. In the second stage, the serenity of the music clashes with the apocalyptic menace of the debris cloud as you attempt to reach the icons and learn horrifying facts about space junk...but, more likely than not, get destroyed by it and become part of it, sort of like Nirvana.
				        <br><br>
				        I programmed the first stage, which you can play in your browser using the link below.

				        Arduino Invader crosses classic Space Invaders-influenced gameplay with a homemade controller for that raw, 'arcades are dead so I made my own' feeling. So punk!
				        <br><br>
				        The project uses an Arduino UNO, a potentiometer, and a button. Powered by the computer, the UNO generates electrical current and sends it to a breadboard, where the potentiometer (to change electrical current strength) and button (to complete or break a circuit) are plugged in. The UNO also connects via Arduino code to a Processing application, which interprets the electrical information, so you can spin the potentiometer dial to fly the ship across the game screen and press the button to fire the laser.
				        <br><br>
				        This project also doubles as an arts and craft experience for you, the player, since you'll need to assemble your own copy of the controller to play the game--which you can certainly do using the included documentation. Ha! However, for those who, for some reason, are reluctant to dip into physical computing, I also implemented a version with traditional keyboard controls, which you can play in your browser via the link below. Is this as cool? I leave it up to you to decide.
				        <br><br>
				        Arduino Invader, developed in October of 2012, was my own first foray into physical computing, for an early project at Parsons. Make sure to watch the video wherein I play the game one-handed while recording the video with the other hand, because why not?"

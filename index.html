				        data-description="Rifftide is a musical exploration game. The player jumps into a world made of sheet music and rides on streams of music notation, creating the soundtrack live through play by literally hitting the notes. The game mixes platforming and endless runner mechanics with a skating/surfing-inspired style, and enables the player to experiment with music composition simply by jumping, spinning, and moving through the world--no music knowledge required.
				        <br><br>
				        I created Rifftide as my thesis project for the MFA in Design and Technology at Parsons The New School for Design, and it was featured in the <a target='_blank' href='http://mfadt.parsons.edu/2014/'>2014 Thesis Show</a>. The game features my own original music compositions. Made during Spring 2014 and programmed in openFrameworks."

Play begins in a dreary apartment where the only means of escape is to place a cardboard box over your head and let the power of imagination carry you away. Specifically it carries you away to a dreamscape of cheeseball-launching catapults. Catch and eat the cheeseballs to prolong the dream; fail and it's back to the apartment to start over. Use the Rift to control the whole experience simply by looking--no buttons required.
				        <br><br>
				        Project Cheese is a Team Cheeto production for the Recursive Reality class at Parsons. Team Cheeto is: Alec McClure (graphics and coding); Julie Huynh (coding); Jimmy Tang (graphics); J. Matthew Griffis (coding). Made in March of 2014 and developed with Unity. Requires the Oculus Rift."

Another propels. The third button fires the gun. / Two players on each keyboard means this surely will be fun!
				        <br><br>
				        I collaborated with <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sanchezmauricio.net/'>Mauricio Sanchez-Duque</a> to create this follow-up to our previous game for the Algorithmic Animation class at Parsons. Once again we prioritized making players share the same keyboard, but because it only accepts six simultaneous button inputs and we have a three-button-per-player control scheme for a four-player game, math necessitates extra hardware. So Players 3 and 4 use a second computer's keyboard, connected via a custom app I wrote using OSC over a network connection.

				        data-description="Before my Parsons MFA DT thesis project became Rifftide, it was Killer Riff. Also set in a sheet music world in which notes are physical objects, Killer Riff favors non-linear movement, solving puzzles, and sonic experimentation with individual notes rather than set musical ideas (at least in the prototype). The player can run and jump through the 2D environment, but also record notes he or she comes across and play them back elsewhere...and of course the notes also function as platforms...
				        <br><br>
				        The transformation into Rifftide left Killer Rift in an as-yet-unfinished state, but I documented the concept and process thoroughly, and perhaps someday Killer Riff will return to melt faces and perplex minds. Made in December of 2013 and programmed in openFrameworks."

I don't know, but no other game besides Terry Cavanagh's <a target='_blank' href='http://superhexagon.com/'>Super Hexagon</a> has demanded I seek post-credits closure by making response art in the form of an interactive existential inquiry into...well, you know.
				        <br><br>
				        I created What Lies Beyond and composed its primary musical theme as the combined final project for the 'Major Studio 2' and 'Narrative and Dynamic Systems' classes at Parsons. Controls: move with the ARROWS; interact with SPACE. Made in May of 2013 and programmed in openFrameworks."

Games today, though...they're soft. They explain everything. They do things for you. They even take control away so you don't have to work too hard and strain yourself. Yes, between endless cut-scenes and endless runners, it's like these games just don't want to be played! This can only end in a game that verbally abuses the player for trying to play it.
				        <br><br>
				        And here it is.

				        I created Don't Play Me Bro for the class Humor and Code at Parsons. Made in May of 2013 and programmed in openFrameworks."

The robot does hover, though, so there wouldn't be friction. Consistency! Featuring Robot from the aforementioned 3D modeling.

				        <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sanchezmauricio.net/'>Mauricio Sanchez-Duque</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.michaelkahane.com/'>Michael Kahane</a> and I created this prototype for our Major Studio 2 class at Parsons, with the goal of exploring what happens when many people use the same keyboard simultaneously. We found out the hard way that the keyboard only recognizes up to six simultaneous buttons inputs; fortunately the chaotic nature of the shoot-em-up action means it's not too much of a problem even with four players. The combination engine/cannon means every attack moves the player toward the target, making for tense action. Made in March of 2013 and programmed in JavaScript using Processing.js."

				        <br><br>
				        What, you want more than that? OK, how about 13 levels of reach-the-goal action, multiple endings, 'unlimited lives' and 'single life' modes, all sorts of statistics-tracking (including Best Time to get through the game), and squash-and-stretch animation for that charismatic square with three jumps to spare? 
				        <br><br>
				        I made You Can Triple-Jump for my Level Design independent study at Parsons. I designed the levels around three primary principles: teaching the player how to play using the level layouts themselves (implicit tutorial); applying the core mechanic of triple-jumping in as many ways and contexts as possible; providing a fluctuating (but gradually increasing) challenge with sufficient variety to maintain interest.

				        data-description="The challenge: design an experience that takes full advantage of the affordances of the Oculus Rift. In other words, something about acting on things by looking at them while wearing a visor. Listen, it's pretty obvious where this is going. 
				        <br><br>
				        You are a...special individual with the 'gift' of shooting lasers from your eyes. You can control the beams with your stylish visor, but you need some practice. Enter the simulation room and train against an army of fearsome mannequins, shooting-gallery-style.
				        <br><br>
				        Cycloculus was created by <a target='_blank' href='http://www.whomakesgames.me/'>K. Anthony Marefat</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://bryan-ma.com/'>Bryan Ma</a>, and me for the Recursive Reality class at Parsons. Anthony and I split most of the coding duties, while Bryan delivered the 3D models, beam effects, and the rest of the visual design.
				        <br><br>
				        Cycloculus achieves several objectives we set for ourselves. First and foremost, we control the experience almost exclusively with looking, the primary function and greatest strength of the hardware. The project avoids the use of external controllers that would be cumbersome and disruptive to use while immersed in the visor.
				        <br><br>
				        Second, we give the player the ability to fire the laser by tapping the side of the visor; in the prototype this takes the form of a MakeyMakey unit and some tin foil to complete a circuit and simulate a button-press whenever the person makes contact. This adds a feeling of control, the tactile satisfaction of tapping a button, and contextual consistency since it makes sense within the narrative context to be tapping the visor to fire.
				        <br><br>
				        Third, the experience is immediately intuitive and conveys a sense of power and fun, as we discovered through playtesting.
				        <br><br>
				        Finally, despite the crudeness of the prototype in its software and hardware implementations, Cycloculus attains a degree of immersion and presence, as we saw in our playtesters' visceral reactions to the flying objects, their laughter and delight as they blasted the targets, and their willingness to play for extended periods.

Use the Rift to control the whole experience simply by looking--no buttons required.

				        I collaborated with <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sanchezmauricio.com/'>Mauricio Sanchez Duque</a> to create this follow-up to our previous game for the Algorithmic Animation class at Parsons. Once again we prioritized making players share the same keyboard, but because it only accepts six simultaneous button inputs and we have a three-button-per-player control scheme for a four-player game, math necessitates extra hardware. So Players 3 and 4 use a second computer's keyboard, connected via a custom app I wrote using OSC over a network connection.

				        data-description="Before my Parsons MFA DT thesis project became Rifftide, it was Killer Riff. Also set in a sheet music world in which notes are physical objects, Killer Riff favors non-linear movement, solving puzzles, and sonic experimentation with individual notes rather than set musical ideas (at least in the prototype). The player can run and jump through the 2D environment, but also record notes he or she comes across and play them back elsewhere...and of course the notes also function as platforms...
				        <br><br>
				        The transformation into Rifftide left Killer Rift in an as-yet-unfinished state, but I documented the concept and process thoroughly, and perhaps someday Killer Riff will return to melt faces and perplex minds. Made in December of 2013 and programmed in openFrameworks."

				        data-description="In the fall of 2013, Parsons collaborated with Miami's New World Symphony to explore new ways to integrate technology into the classical concert form and present the material in a fresh way.
				        <br><br>
				        Splitting into teams, the class used the music and the musicians themselves as raw materials to transform a public performance in NWS's spectacular Frank Gehry-designed concert hall into a transmedia synaesthetic experience.
				        <br><br>
				        I worked with <a target='_blank' href='http://www.michaelkahane.com/'>Michael Kahane</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://quincybock.com/'>Quincy Bock</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sanchezmauricio.com/'>Mauricio Sanchez Duque</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.fracastelli.com/'>Francesca Castelli</a> to make 'Breath and Brass,' a visual piece for Poulencâ€™s 'Sonata for Horn, Trumpet and Trombone' that illuminates both the physical and technical aspects of musical performance.
				        <br><br>
				        We built a custom sensor to measure the musicians' breathing, and employed FFT software to analyze the music they played. Our custom-built program blended and interpreted the breathing and music data to synthesize a visual accompaniment live during the concert.
				        <br><br>
				        I worked on the software, primarily on coding the 'Lines' segment (one of two narrative themes) and on merging everyone's individual programs into a single application.
				        <br><br>
				        The class was conducted under the leadership of Ed Keller, Joe Saavedra, and Leif Percifield. Breath and Brass was made in November of 2013 and programmed in openFrameworks and Arduino."

				        Designed in the style of a game show for public performance, Dicksit solicits a prompt from the audience (inspired by improv comedy), then searches Twitter for a related Tweet, which goes up on a public screen for all to see. Each contestant receives on a private mobile device a random thread of images from the notorious 4chan message boards--some of the images might even be appropriate for work and young children! (Probably not, though.)
				        <br><br>Each candidate selects an image to represent the content of the Tweet, and sends it to the public screen, with no name attached. Once each candidate has chosen, the audience votes to determine the winning image. The victorious contestant reveals his or her identity and is showered in glory, while the losers console themselves with the grotesqueries of the rest of their 4chan threads.
				        <br><br>
				        This extremely tongue-in-cheek game using cutting-edge technology was a group project between me, <a target='_blank' href='http://josephrogermoore.com/'>Joe Moore</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://jenniferpresto.com/'>Jennifer Presto</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.siriwanpen.com/'>Siri Wanpen</a>.

				        data-description="The aliens are invading! Oh, there's just one. Persistent little thing, though. And all we have to fend it off is this wacky technology...
				        <br><br>
				        Arduino Invader crosses classic Space Invaders-influenced gameplay with a homemade controller for that raw, 'arcades are dead so I made my own' feeling. So punk!
				        <br><br>
				        The project uses an Arduino UNO, a potentiometer, and a button. Powered by the computer, the UNO generates electrical current and sends it to a breadboard, where the potentiometer (to change electrical current strength) and button (to complete or break a circuit) are plugged in. The UNO also connects via Arduino code to a Processing application, which interprets the electrical information, so you can spin the potentiometer dial to fly the ship across the game screen and press the button to fire the laser.
				        <br><br>
				        This project also doubles as an arts and craft experience for you, the player, since you'll need to assemble your own copy of the controller to play the game--which you can certainly do using the included documentation. Ha! However, for those who, for some reason, are reluctant to dip into physical computing, I also implemented a version with traditional keyboard controls, which you can play in your browser via the link below. Is this as cool? I leave it up to you to decide.
				        <br><br>
				        Arduino Invader, developed in October of 2012, was my own first foray into physical computing, for an early project at Parsons. Make sure to watch the video wherein I play the game one-handed while recording the video with the other hand, because why not?"

						<p>Hi, my name is Matt, and I design and develop playful interactive experiences. With degrees from <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sjc.edu/about/why-sjc/'>St. John's College</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/'>Parsons The New School for Design</a>, my creative and technological background is weird, wonderful, and well-rounded, and emphasizes these things:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Critical thinking and logic</li>
							<li>Collaboration</li>
							<li>Adaptability</li>
							<li>Intellectual strength</li>
							<li>Leadership</li>
							<li>Self-motivation</li>
							<li>Imagination</li>
						</ul>

						<p>I use a multidisciplinary skill set to make all kinds of things. For example, I hand-coded this website (<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.jmatthewgriffis.com/search/label/portfolio">read about it</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jmatthewgriffis/mySite">see the code</a>).

						<p id="workisabout"><span class="embiggen">exploration</span> and <span class="embiggen">experimentation, creativity, reflection, reaction,</span> and <span class="embiggen">delight.</span></p>

						<p>I make physics systems for fun, but don't hold it against me. I'm also a passionate musician and writer. Contact me about freelance or consulting opportunities or to say hi.</p>

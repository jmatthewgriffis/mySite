Play begins in a dreary apartment where the only means of escape is to place a cardboard box over your head and let the power of imagination carry you away. Specifically it carries you away to a dreamscape of cheeseball-launching catapults. Catch and eat the cheeseballs to prolong the dream; fail and it's back to the apartment to start over. Use the Rift to control the whole experience simply by looking--no buttons required.

				        I collaborated with <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sanchezmauricio.com/'>Mauricio Sanchez Duque</a> to create this follow-up to our previous game for the Algorithmic Animation class at Parsons. Once again we prioritized making players share the same keyboard, but because it only accepts six simultaneous button inputs and we have a three-button-per-player control scheme for a four-player game, math necessitates extra hardware. So Players 3 and 4 use a second computer's keyboard, connected via a custom app I wrote using OSC over a network connection.

				        data-description="Before my Parsons MFA DT thesis project became Rifftide, it was Killer Riff. Also set in a sheet music world in which notes are physical objects, Killer Riff favors non-linear movement, solving puzzles, and sonic experimentation with individual notes rather than set musical ideas (at least in the prototype). The player can run and jump through the 2D environment, but also record notes he or she comes across and play them back elsewhere...and of course the notes also function as platforms...
				        <br><br>
				        The transformation into Rifftide left Killer Rift in an as-yet-unfinished state, but I documented the concept and process thoroughly, and perhaps someday Killer Riff will return to melt faces and perplex minds. Made in December of 2013 and programmed in openFrameworks."

				        data-description="In the fall of 2013, Parsons collaborated with Miami's New World Symphony to explore new ways to integrate technology into the classical concert form and present the material in a fresh way.
				        <br><br>
				        Splitting into teams, the class used the music and the musicians themselves as raw materials to transform a public performance in NWS's spectacular Frank Gehry-designed concert hall into a transmedia synaesthetic experience.
				        <br><br>
				        I worked with <a target='_blank' href='http://www.michaelkahane.com/'>Michael Kahane</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://quincybock.com/'>Quincy Bock</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sanchezmauricio.com/'>Mauricio Sanchez Duque</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.fracastelli.com/'>Francesca Castelli</a> to make 'Breath and Brass,' a visual piece for Poulenc’s 'Sonata for Horn, Trumpet and Trombone' that illuminates both the physical and technical aspects of musical performance.
				        <br><br>
				        We built a custom sensor to measure the musicians' breathing, and employed FFT software to analyze the music they played. Our custom-built program blended and interpreted the breathing and music data to synthesize a visual accompaniment live during the concert.
				        <br><br>
				        I worked on the software, primarily on coding the 'Lines' segment (one of two narrative themes) and on merging everyone's individual programs into a single application.
				        <br><br>
				        The class was conducted under the leadership of Ed Keller, Joe Saavedra, and Leif Percifield. Breath and Brass was made in November of 2013 and programmed in openFrameworks and Arduino."

				        In all seriousness, what's summer camp without a sack race, and that's probably what NBCUniversal thought when they commissioned TreSensa to create this mobile web game for their Summer Camp property.

I also worked with a visual artist to integrate graphics and animation.

				        Super Sack Race, created in July of 2013, was developed in the TreSensa Game Engine (TGE), a proprietary engine for mobile web game development, based in JavaScript and HTML5.

				        <br><br>
				        Designed in the style of a game show for public performance, Dicksit solicits a prompt from the audience (inspired by improv comedy), then searches Twitter for a related Tweet, which goes up on a public screen for all to see. Each contestant receives on a private mobile device a random thread of images from the notorious 4chan message boards--some of the images might even be appropriate for work and young children! (Probably not, though.)
				        <br><br>Each candidate selects an image to represent the content of the Tweet, and sends it to the public screen, with no name attached. Once each candidate has chosen, the audience votes to determine the winning image. The victorious contestant reveals his or her identity and is showered in glory, while the losers console themselves with the grotesqueries of the rest of their 4chan threads.
				        <br><br>
				        This extremely tongue-in-cheek game using cutting-edge technology was a group project between me, <a target='_blank' href='http://josephrogermoore.com/'>Joe Moore</a>, <a target='_blank' href='http://jenniferpresto.com/'>Jennifer Presto</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.siriwanpen.com/'>Siri Wanpen</a>.

The robot does hover, though, so there wouldn't be friction. Consistency! Featuring Robot from the aforementioned 3D modeling.

We found out the hard way that the keyboard only recognizes up to six simultaneous buttons inputs; fortunately the chaotic nature of the shoot-em-up action means it's not too much of a problem even with four players. The combination engine/cannon means every attack moves the player toward the target, making for tense action. Made in March of 2013 and programmed in JavaScript using Processing.js."

Exploring how to illuminate and promote discussion of otherwise-invisible networks on which the public depends, we used Processing to create in two weeks this prototype of an educational game about the phenomenon of 'space junk.'
				        <br><br>
				        In the first stage, dodge a multitude of satellites to make it into orbit. In the second stage, the serenity of the music clashes with the apocalyptic menace of the debris cloud as you attempt to reach the icons and learn horrifying facts about space junk...but, more likely than not, get destroyed by it and become part of it, sort of like Nirvana.
				        <br><br>
				        I programmed the first stage, which you can play in your browser using the link below. I also composed and performed music for both stages, which unfortunately wouldn't run in the browser.

				        <br><br>
				        Arduino Invader crosses classic Space Invaders-influenced gameplay with a homemade controller for that raw, 'arcades are dead so I made my own' feeling. So punk!
				        <br><br>
				        The project uses an Arduino UNO, a potentiometer, and a button. Powered by the computer, the UNO generates electrical current and sends it to a breadboard, where the potentiometer (to change electrical current strength) and button (to complete or break a circuit) are plugged in. The UNO also connects via Arduino code to a Processing application, which interprets the electrical information, so you can spin the potentiometer dial to fly the ship across the game screen and press the button to fire the laser.
				        <br><br>
				        This project also doubles as an arts and craft experience for you, the player, since you'll need to assemble your own copy of the controller to play the game--which you can certainly do using the included documentation. Ha! However, for those who, for some reason, are reluctant to dip into physical computing, I also implemented a version with traditional keyboard controls, which you can play in your browser via the link below. Is this as cool? I leave it up to you to decide.
				        <br><br>
				        Arduino Invader, developed in October of 2012, was my own first foray into physical computing, for an early project at Parsons. Make sure to watch the video wherein I play the game one-handed while recording the video with the other hand, because why not?"

						<p>Hi, my name is Matt, and I design and develop playful interactive experiences. With degrees from <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sjc.edu/about/why-sjc/'>St. John's College</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/'>Parsons The New School for Design</a>, my creative and technological background is weird, wonderful, and well-rounded, and emphasizes these things:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Critical thinking and logic</li>
							<li>Collaboration</li>
							<li>Adaptability</li>
							<li>Intellectual strength</li>
							<li>Leadership</li>
							<li>Self-motivation</li>
							<li>Imagination</li>
						</ul>

						<p>I use a multidisciplinary skill set to make all kinds of things. For example, I hand-coded this website (<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.jmatthewgriffis.com/2014/08/postmortem-redesigning-my-portfolio-web.html">read about it</a>). My work is about:</p>

						<p id="workisabout"><span class="embiggen">exploration</span> and <span class="embiggen">experimentation, creativity, reflection, reaction,</span> and <span class="embiggen">delight.</span></p>

						<p>I make physics systems for fun, but don't hold it against me. I'm also a passionate musician and writer. Contact me about freelance or consulting opportunities or just to say hi.</p>
